		<p class="header-wannabe">hello, there!</p>
		<p>i'm Alesha, and I have had several roles in this team!</p>
		<p>they consist of:</p>
		<div style="text-align:center; margin:-20px;">
		<ul style="display:inline-block; text-align:left; list-style-type:square; font-size:23px;">
		<li>being the one to code a shoot 'em up game by using GDScript,<br>a programming language exclusive to Godot!</li>
		<li>being the interviewer.</li>
		<li>being the narrator for our roleplay video.</li>
		</ul>
		</div>
		<p>now, you may <span class="tiny-silly">or may not</span> be wondering,<br>"how was your experience throughout this whole case study?"</p>
		<p><strong><i>well...</i></strong></p>
		</div>
		
		<div style="border: 4px inset #c47ec1; background-color:#f7d5f6;">
		<p class="header-wannabe">chapter 1: the planning phase</p>
		<p>on the day that Sir Willie announced that we have to come up with something for our case study,<br>my mind came up with three possibilities:</p>
		<ul style="display:inline-block; text-align:left; list-style-type:square; font-size:23px; margin:10px">
		<li>trying out three different video editing programs to make... well, a video!</li>
		<li>trying out three different audio editing programs to make <span class="tiny-silly">acceptable</span> music.</li>
		<li>trying out three different programming langauges to make a shoot 'em up game.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>in the end, our group decided to choose the last option,<br>
		as we'd think it would be a fun challenge!</p>
		<p>to be perfectly honest, i've actually already had experience in building a shoot 'em up game; but in Scratch!</p>
		<p>it was supposed to be for my Fundamentals of Computer Science project when I was in Form 1,<br>
		that <span class="tiny-silly">my teacher claimed to be</span> would be worth 30% of our grade... and i was really proud of it!</p>
		<p>but the teacher at that time didn't even look at our class' projects,<br>
		and gave us all full marks for the project,<br>
		<i>even though some of them haven't even done it.</i></p>

		</figure>
		<p>nonetheless, i'm still really proud of the Scratch game i made 'til this day,<br>
		and you can do so down below!</p>

		<p>anyways, enough talking about the past!</p>
		<p>how has my game from 2018, using Scratch, differ from the one i've made <i>now</i>?

		<p class="header-wannabe">chapter 2: the coding arc</p>
		<p>although i initially planned on coding in C# while using Unity to code my shoot 'em up game,<br>
		there were a <i>couple</i> of reasons of why i decided to use Godot instead:</p>
		<ul style="display:inline-block; text-align:left; list-style-type:square; font-size:23px; margin:10px">
		<li>my 4-year-old laptop would probably combust trying to load up Unity.</li>
		<li>i've already had Godot installed before doing this case study.</li>
		<li>Godot is <i>completely</i> free! <a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-engine-subscription-cost-unreal-godot-indie-dev-1850831032">unlike another game engine...</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>now, almost the <i>entire time</i> that i was coding my game, i mistakenly thought that i was coding in C#.</p>
		<p>it wasn't until i actually read Godot's official coding guide that i found out that Godot has their OWN programming language, named GDScript.</p>
		<p>here is an example of how different GDScript is from C#:</p>
		<p>yeah... uh... pretty embarrasing mistake!<br>
		but i was halfway done with the game and i wasn't willing to switch all of my coding to C#,<br>
		since most of the coding tutorials that gave step-by-step instructions of the game that i was trying to make use GDScript anyway.</p>
		<p>and besides, i think it would be interesting to work with a programming language that's exclusive to one game engine and compare it with the others.</p>
		<p>here is a day-by-day account of the the kind of progress i did during the whole time i coded the game, and how i felt about it!</p>

					<ul>
					<li>Discovered Kaan Alpar’s coding tutorials.</li>

					<ul>
					<li>Coded the ‘animations’ that would play when the spaceship is turning left and right.</li>
					<li>Coded the bullets that would shoot out of the spaceship’s muzzle whenever the player presses the spacebar.</li>
					<li>Coded the enemy’s movement, animations and a function where the enemy would die if it collided with the player’s bullets.</li>
					<li>Coded a function where the player would die if it collided with the enemy.</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
				<td>For some reason, it took an ABSURDLY long amount of time to figure out how to change the spaceship’s sprite whenever it moved to the left or to the right.<br>
				Same goes for the animations that would play when the enemy is moving from the top to the bottom of the screen.<br>
				Thankfully, I was able to remedy the problem by referring to this video.</td>
