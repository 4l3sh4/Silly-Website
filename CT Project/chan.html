                        My Space invader is a game in which the player controls a ship that moves horizontally and vertically
                        while shooting aliens. If one alien reaches the bottom of the screen, the game will end. This is a website
                        that showcases how I made space invader using python and pygame, and also my experience along the way.

                    <p class="paragraph"> Python is a programming language created by Guido Van Rossum. While commonly associated 
                    with the reptile, it is actually inspired by Monty Python's Flying Circus, a British sketch comedy series. Back then, Van Rossum needed 
                    a short, unique and mysterious name while he was implementing the programming language. At the time, he just happened to be reading 
                    Monty Python's published script, and so Python came to be the iconic name associated with the programming language.
                        
                    <br><Br>At its core, Python was meant to be a powerful, but fun language. It was designed to be approachable and easy to use.
                    If you can read English, chances are you can learn how to use Python easily. This is why Python is popular and used by
                    programmers worldwide. This is also the reason why I have chose Python as the programming language for my part in this Case Study. It is well known to be
                    a beginner friendly language, and I was very excited to start learning to program.

                    Finding information
                </h2>
                
                <p class="paragraph">Like most projects, it starts with gathering information. I first found the book "Python Crash Course" 
                    by Eric Matthes which had a space invader tutorial in it. Next, I found a youtube tutorial called
                    "Pygame Tutorial for Beginners - Python Game Development Course" by Freecodecamp. Initially,I was going to go through
                    making the game using the book, but in the end I went through using the youtube tutorial.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    I found it easy to follow Attreya Bhatt's freecodecamp tutorial. He narrates clearly, and properly explains the what, the how,
                    and the whys of his code. I was learning what python was doing instead of just copying the lines of code from the tutorial.
                    Going through the whole process, I also learned a bit of game development pipeline when it comes to games like space invader.
                    Additionally, I learned some applications of mathematics when it comes programming in the case of using X and Y values to moves
                    players and aliens, and also the distance formula to make collision happen.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Now, here are some takeaways you may be interested in and what I learned throughout the journey. 
                        Over the course of making this game, I kept forgetting why some parts of the code even runs so I had to constantly look it back up. 
                        So it would be more efficient to just comment beside your codes. (It can even reinforce your memory of it) Also make use of 
                        online resources, if you run into an unintelligble error code, google, reddit, and stacked overflow will have your back. 
                        This is essentially debugging, you can learn to find solutions people found online and apply them to your very own code. '
                        Lastly, you will need patience. Sometimes, Python won't understand what you want to and hit you in the head with random error codes. 
                        In this case, the solution will not always be obvious, and going through your code to find mistakes can be tedious. But in the end when it works
                        it will be worth the satisfaction of seeing lines of code turn into something functional.

                    <h1 class="header2">Some final thoughts....</h1>
                    <p class="paragraph">All in all, making Space invader in Python was a great learning experience for me. As you know,
                        Python is a straight forward language with simple syntax and intuitive commands, so I was able to focus more on learning what the codes did rather than the syntax of 
                        the language itself. This means I may have a harder time coding if I were to use another language, say C# or Java. I enjoyed banging my head at
                        the error codes to finally seeing the game come together, allbeit with the guide of a tutorial. It was very satisfying all the same. I definitely do recommend making
                        a game as a project using Python, it doesn't have to be space invader, it can be any game, tic tac toe, or even a word guessing game. You just have to
                        get started and you're good to go!</p>
