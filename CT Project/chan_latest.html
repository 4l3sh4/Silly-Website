                        Space invader is a game in which the player controls a ship that moves horizontally and vertically
                        while shooting aliens. If one alien reaches the bottom of the screen, the game will end. This is a website
                        that showcases how I made space invader using python and pygame, and also my experience along the way.

                <p class="paragraph">Like most projects, it starts with gathering information. I first found the book "Python Crash Course" by
                    by Eric Matthes which had a space invader tutorial in it. Next, I found a youtube tutorial called
                    "Pygame Tutorial for Beginners - Python Game Development Course" by Freecodecamp. Initially,I was going to go through
                    making the game using the book, but in the end I went through using the youtube tutorial.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    I found it easy to follow Attreya Bhatt's freecodecamp tutorial. He narrates clearly, and properly explains the what, the how,
                    and the whys of his code. I was learning what python was doing instead of just copying the lines of code from the tutorial.
                    Going through the whole process, I also learned a bit of game development pipeline when it comes to games like space invader.
                    Additionally, I learned some applications of mathematics when it comes programming in the case of using X and Y values to moves
                    players and aliens, and also the distance formula to make collision happen.

                        Now, some takeaways you may be interested in and what I learned throughout the journey was to comment reasonably
                        so you do not forget what certain parts of your code do. Over the course of making this game, I kept forgetting 
                        why some parts of the code even runs so I had to constantly look it back up. So it would be more efficient to just
                        comment beside your codes. (It can even reinforce your memory of it) Also make use of online resources, if you run
                        into an unintelligble error code, google, reddit, and stacked overflow will have your back. This is essentially debugging,
                        you can learn to find solutions people found online and apply them to your very own code.

                    <h1 class="header2">Final Thoughts</h1>
                    <p class="paragraph">All in all, making Space invader using was a great learning experience for me. I enjoyed banging my head at
                        the error codes to finally see the game come together, allbeit with the guide of a tutorial. I recommend making
                        a game as a project, it doesn't have to be space invader, it can any game, tic tac toe, or even a word guessing game.</p>
